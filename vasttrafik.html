              V√§sttrafik faces a big task, making their 'ToGo' app user-friendly
              for people of all ages and backgrounds, whether they're tech-savvy
              or not. <br />
              This means covering a lot of ground, from showing bus schedules to
              explaining bike rules on trains and giving students the lowdown on
              ticket prices, all while not blowing the budget or wrecking the
              existing design.

              To really get to know our users, we dove into some serious
              research. We started by creating a user persona, basically a
              detailed profile of a typical app user.
              <br />We did this through surveys and chats, which helped us
              really understand what our users needed and what bugged them.

              Our research pointed out three big problems that needed fixing,
              based on the data and feedback we got.
              <br />To come up with ideas to solve these problems, we started
              with the "Crazy 8" technique. We brainstormed and had workshops
              where we shared ideas. We ended up picking three solutions that
              struck a balance between being effective and simple.

              We put our chosen designs to the test with real users to make sure
              they were easy to use and did what they were supposed to.
              <br />As we went along, we made sure our solutions didn't just
              work for users but also fit with what V√§sttrafik wanted, like
              sticking to their design system, vision and business goals.

            If you're not a fan of problem-solving, this project might not be
            your cup of tea. It's been a real eye-opener to face unexpected
            challenges continuously. Our goal of creating an app that works for
            everyone is a massive and thrilling task.
            <br>Being part of this project
            from start to finish has been incredibly educational. It's taught me
            the importance of thorough UX research and planning. We've always
            circled back to the main question: "Where are we headed?"
            <br>Our project not only expanded our user base without sacrificing usability or a
            minimalist design but also aligned perfectly with V√§sttrafik and
            V√§stra G√∂talandsregionen's objectives. Meeting both the user's and
            the client's needs has been our guiding principle.
